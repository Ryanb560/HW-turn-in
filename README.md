Recommendations If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?  What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

One component that I would like to change is the control of the wallet keys

Wallet keys - A cryptocurrency wallet is a piece of software that keeps track of the secret keys used to digitally sign cryptocurrency transactions for distributed ledgers. Because those keys are the only way to prove ownership of digital assets – and to execute transactions that transfer them or change them in some way – they are a critical piece of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Creating ways for users to control their own crypto currency would be a major step for Coinbase.
